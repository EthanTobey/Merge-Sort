# Art Database Merge Sort

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **merge sort algorithm** designed to organize an art database for a fictitious museum. The algorithm efficiently sorts art pieces and is used to provide various sorted samplings of randomly generated art entries. 

This project demonstrates the practical application of merge sort in managing and organizing data, specifically within the context of an art database.

## Key Features

- **Merge Sort Implementation**: A classic merge sort algorithm written in Java for efficient data sorting.
- **Art Database Simulation**: Generates random art pieces to simulate sorting operations on an art collection.
- **Sorted Samplings**: Returns different sorted subsets of the generated art pieces to illustrate the algorithm's effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The project is fully written in Java, utilizing object-oriented programming and efficient sorting logic.
